# Soap Dispenser Holder

This object was designed to hold four soap dispensers I purchased on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com.au/dp/B0BCKDQKRH).

This particular one will be fitted in my van (drilled through and screwed to the kitchen top).

The triangle cutouts are used to lower the amount of materials, while not requiring supports.
